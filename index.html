        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">  <br> Hello! My name is Jaya Madhuri Gazula and I'm a current full-time student at the University of California- Riverside in California. I'm a dedicated and passionate student that values engagement with peers and familiar circles of people, but equally important involvement with the outside community. Iâ€™m hardworking, proactive, bright, driven, compassionate, knowledgeable, informative, etc.<br>
        <br> I attended Santa Susana High School where I concentrated on scientific applications on the pre-health track. I also took medical assistant clinical and office administration classes at my local CTE school - Ventura Country Office of Education Moorpark branch. I founded a Future Business Leaders of America Chapter, taught business fundamentals to high school students. I gave school tours, answered questions, and promoted Santa Susana High School as an SSHS Ambassador. I implemented creative & immersive lesson plans for middle school students as a Spanish TA. I was the Logistics & Decorations Committee leader for the Festival of Arts Youth Movement (FAYM). I organized the STEAM EXPO, Health Fair, Science Fair, and Blood Drives at school. I also created workshops to help senior citizens with technology and financial literacy workshops for high school students.<br>
        <br> As VP of FBLA, I worked closely with the President to meet the goals of the club. Created and executed plans for fundraising campaigns and chapter activities such as a mock Shark Tank, and financial literacy workshops, etc. to increase members' knowledge about the business world. I established connections with other chapters using networking to plan multi-chapter socials. I increased membership from 0 to 120 members, raised $6,000 in grant money, made 50+ industry connections for financial literacy workshops as president of FBLA at school. As a TA, I assisted faculty members with classroom instruction, exams, record keeping, and other miscellaneous projects. Tutored/Mentored students during office hours, lead discussion sections, and informed students of their final grades. As a PR officer for our robotics club I assisted in the creation of team websites, social media accounts, etc; worked as a scouting agent during competitions; created a code of conduct + workshops to end gender discrimination. Currently, I intern as a grant writer and business development head for Shelter App Inc. which is a non-profit organization that created an app to connect the homeless and low-income families to reliable resources.<br>
        <br>My learning interests are social media marketing, business management, environmental sustainability, community service, leadership/student government. My interests outside of school include art, reading, cooking, and traveling. My goals for my university experience are to ameliorate interpersonal and problem-solving skills in and out of the classroom. I also want to delve into options and opportunities to find a fitting major and job interest.<br>
        <br>My hard skills include Canva, Facebook/Instagram Ads, Google Analytics, Microsoft Excel & PowerPoint, and GSuite applications. Iâ€™m also trilingual. I speak Telugu, Spanish, and English but I hope to learn more languages in the future. My soft skills include time management, verbal and written communication, leadership, conflict resolution, and most importantly, teamwork. I hope to learn new programming languages and expanding my programming skills through the GitHub platform.<br>
